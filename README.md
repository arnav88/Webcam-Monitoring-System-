# Webcam-Monitoring-System

● Developed a Webcam Monitoring system for Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. Lucknow
division's IT department.

● The program's primary goal was to use the webcam for monitoring purposes so that if a
cabin/desk is left empty, it can be monitored. When the user returns, it can see the
images captured by the webcam of the surroundings or people who have arrived in the
user's absence.

● The program asks the user to specify the time interval at which webcam images will be
automatically taken while they are not present, as well as the directory where the
images should be saved
